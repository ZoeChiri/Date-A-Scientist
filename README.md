## Machine Learning Project



This project leverages Codecademy's dataset to construct, train, and evaluate a machine learning model aimed at predicting user compatibility.
I appreciated the pun "Date-A-Scientist" _data scientist_.

**Project Goals:** 🌱



- Explore the application of Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to understand user interactions and preferences.



- Develop supervised and unsupervised machine learning models to identify patterns in user behavior and compatibility.



- Evaluate model performance and generate insights for potential applications in user matching and community building.
